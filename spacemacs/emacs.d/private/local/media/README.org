* Description
*Fork note:* This layer is based on [[https://github.com/alejandroerickson][@alejandroerickson]]â€™s PR from
https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/pull/6435.

This layer installs and configures media library management software EMMS.

https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/

* Install
To use the media layer:
- place this repository in one of Spacemacs's layer directories
  (=~/.emacs.d/private/local/exwm=, =~/.spacemacs.d/private/exwm=, or =~/.spacemacs.d/layers/exwm=)
- add the layer in your =~/.spacemacs=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(media))
#+end_src

Optionally, if you have a collection of media files in a single directory tree,
you can set the root directory of that tree as EMMS's default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq emms-source-file-default-directory "/path/to/music/")
#+end_src

When you first open the EMMS browser it will prompt you to add music. It then
builds a cache of track info, defaulting to the directory =~/.emacs.d/.cache/emms=.
Before doing so install a track info reader to properly extract track
information, otherwise you will encounter errors and the track info will not be
read. We recommend you use TagLib, see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/manual/#Using-TagLib][EMMS manual]] - for how-to compile and install.
If you use [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix]], then see [[https://github.com/Potpourri/dotfiles/blob/master/nixos/nixpkgs/overlays/potpourri-overlay.nix][my overlay]].

If it compiles successfully, put the executable in your =PATH= (you can check
the value of =PATH= with the =getenv= command). Now when you add music it should
populate the smart browser properly with names of tracks, albums, artists, etc.
Re-add your music by deleting the =~/.emacs.d/.cache/emms= directory, where the cache and
history are located.

Find the home page and full manual here:
- https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/
- https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/manual/

Most importantly, you will need a media player. By default, the media layer is
set up to support mpg321, ogg123, mplayer, and vlc. Install one of these and
ensure that Emacs can find it in your =PATH=.


** EMMS configuration 
   The default configuration for EMMS in the media layer does not show tracks in
   the mode-line, in order to minimise intrusion upon those who do not wish to
   customise the layer.

   EMMS is configured with the following defaults:
   - all stable features of EMMS loaded
   - No track in mode-line
   - F7 to toggle emms smart browse
   - TagLib is the track info reader
   - Several key bindings have been changed to suite evil-mode

** Configuring media keys
   Configuring media keys (play/pause, next, previous) is system dependent, of
   course, but once you learn how to map them to terminal commands you can try
   something like the following:

   #+begin_src sh
   emacsclient --eval "(emms-pause)" || \
   emacsclient  --eval  "(emms-playlist-mode-go)"\
   --eval "(goto-line 1)" --eval "(emms-playlist-mode-play-smart)" \
   --eval  "(emms-playlist-mode-bury-buffer)" || \
   emacsclient --eval "(emms-browser)" \
   --eval "(emms-browse-by-album)"  --eval "(emms-browser-goto-random)" \
   --eval "(emms-browser-add-tracks-and-play)" || \
   say Open and cue up an E M M S playlist in emacs.
   #+end_src
   
   If the Emacs server is running and EMMS is loaded with at least one track in
   the emms-browser, then above command-line instruction will (in order) try to
   play a paused track, try to play the next track after the cursor in the
   playlist, choose an album at random and play it, adding the tracks to the
   playlist.  Failing all of that it issues an audible error message (which here
   uses a buit-in function on Mac OS X).
   
   Commands for previous and next buttons are similar:

   #+begin_src sh
   emacsclient --eval "(emms-next)" || \
   emacsclient  --eval  "(emms-playlist-mode-go)" --eval "(goto-line \
	 1)" --eval "(emms-playlist-mode-play-smart)" --eval \
	 "(emms-playlist-mode-bury-buffer)" ||\
	 emacsclient --eval "(emms-browser)"  --eval
	 "(emms-browse-by-album)"  --eval "(emms-browser-goto-random)"
	 --eval "(emms-browser-add-tracks-and-play)" ||  say Open and cue
	 up an E M M S playlist in emacs. 
   #+end_src
   
   #+begin_src sh
   emacsclient --eval "(emms-previous)" || \
	 emacsclient  --eval  "(emms-playlist-mode-go)" --eval "(goto-line \
	 1)" --eval "(emms-playlist-mode-play-smart)" --eval \
	 "(emms-playlist-mode-bury-buffer)" ||\
	 emacsclient --eval "(emms-browser)"  --eval
	 "(emms-browse-by-album)"  --eval "(emms-browser-goto-random)"
	 --eval "(emms-browser-add-tracks-and-play)" ||  say Open and cue
	 up an E M M S playlist in emacs.
   #+end_src
 
*** Setting the media keys on Mac OS X
    Mac OS X media keys can be rebound with Karabiner (formerly
    KeyRemap4MacBook). First, merge the file `private.xml` included in the media
    layer must with `~/Library/Application\ Support/Karabiner/private.xml`.
    Second, open Karabiner preferences and press "Reload XML". Third, and
    finally, tick the three boxes related to EMMS.
    
* Key bindings
  EMMS browser and playlist modes can be access with leader keys. In Vim-style
  Spacemacs leader keys are accessed with =SPC= (as described in the table) and
  with Emacs style Spacemacs they are accessed with =M-m=.

| Leader Key Binding | Description                                                      |
|--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------|

| SPC a m e          | EMMS prefix                                                      |
| SPC a m e p        | Open current playlist in current buffer.                         |
| SPC a m e b        | Open music browser in current buffer.                            |
| SPC a RET          | Toggle smart browser (browser/playlist/close) in current buffer. |
| SPC a SPC          | Play/pause do-what-I-mean.                                       |
| SPC a .            | Play next track.                                                 |
| SPC a ,            | Play previous track.                                             |

In addition, the smart browser can be accessed through =F7=

Emacs-state key bindings are documented for each mode at

** Evilified keybindings
  A few key bindings differ in evilified-state.

*** Mark Playlists 

In addition to most of the commands for normal playlists, Mark Playlists offer
the usual marking features. Operations should occur on all marked tracks.

| % m         | Marks all tracks in the playlist matching the given regular expression. A prefix argument means to unmark them instead.                                                                     |
