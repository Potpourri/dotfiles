;; All buffers created in EXWM mode are named "*EXWM*". You may want to change

;; this subject:
;; + Always use `exwm-workspace-rename-buffer` to avoid naming conflict.
;; + Only renaming buffer in one hook and avoid it in the other. There's no
;;   guarantee on the order in which they are run.
;; + For applications with multiple windows (e.g. GIMP), the class names of all
;;   windows are probably the same. Using window titles for them makes more
;;   sense.
;; + Some application change its title frequently (e.g. browser, terminal).
;;   Its class name may be more suitable for such case.
;; In the following example, we use class names for all windows expect for
;; Java applications and GIMP.
